    <h2>GAME GUIDE</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Each player starts with a maximum of 8 attempts.</li>
        <li>Both players start with a score of 0.</li>
       
                <li>The selected word is displayed as a series of letter boxes. Each box represents a letter in the word.</li>
                <li>A few letters are randomly revealed to give players an initial hint.</li>
           
      
                <li>Players take turns entering letters to guess the hidden word in 60s.</li>
                <li>Player 1 starts first. After Player 1’s turn, Player 2 takes their turn, and so on.</li>
         
                <li>Players can only enter one letter at a time.</li>
                <li>The entered letter must match the letter at the corresponding position in the word.</li>
      
                <li>If a player guesses a letter correctly, it is revealed in the letter box, and the player earns 10 point.</li>
                <li>The player’s score is updated accordingly.</li>
    
                
                <li>The letter box turns red briefly, and the input is cleared.</li>
            
                <li>The round ends when all letters are revealed, or when a player runs out of attempts.</li>
                <li>If all letters are revealed, the player who guessed the word correctly wins the round.</li>
                <li>If a player runs out of attempts, the round ends, and the other player is declared the winner of that round.</li>
            
        </ul>
